database for travel agency 



About Travel agency management system :

     This project is about travel management system in which we going to implement the database of travel agency. We are going to implement this database in steps. First of all, we will do some research on travel agency. Then we determine that which type of function requirement we need to write in this database. Then we draw ER- diagram according to over function requirement.

       Then we draw relational diagram on the base of ER- diagram. We have to determine the function dependencies.  We also need to normalise our schema to the max normalization form.  After normalization, we need to write schema of this database to implement the different tables of the database. We write required SQL statements to implement tables.

     After all this we use database to store, retrieve, modify and delete the data of all passengers, vehicle information, employee information and payment information etc...
